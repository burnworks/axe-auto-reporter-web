# Template Components

These Astro components are shared by all generated accessibility reports.

- Keep `result_template.astro` and `result_template_noissues.astro` in this directory.
- Generated pages import them at build time; removing or moving the files will break report rendering.

Only update the markup/styles when you need to adjust report output.
